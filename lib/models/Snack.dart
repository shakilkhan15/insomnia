      Eating a handful of almonds may help boost sleep quality. This is because almonds, along with several other types of nuts, are a source of the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin.

Consuming adequate amounts of magnesium may help improve sleep quality - especially for those who have insomnia.

If you want to consume it in morning, take it along with your breakfast

If you want to consume it in the night day, take it before you sleep by eating a handful of almonds
A teaspoon of honey before bed is just what the doctor ordered. The sweet liquid will restock the liver with the glycogen needed to prevent the crisis trigger from the brain. Honey's natural sugars also slightly raise insulin, allowing tryptophan to enter the brain. Tryptophan is an amino acid that is turned into niacin, an essential B vitamin. Niacin is a key player in the creation of serotonin,  a neurotransmitter needed to produce melatonin and put your body to sleep

You can add it to tea, make a little potion, or add some cinnamon, but all you really need is a clean spoon and a jar of raw honey! For sleep, raw honey is also a significantly better choice because it 22% better at making liver glycogen than pasteurized conventional honey.
